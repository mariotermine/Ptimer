PT Cruiser Fan Relay Module

The purpose of the project is to reduce engine bay temperature that climbs when the engine is turned off and allowed to heat soak. Over time, this damages the PCM and puts heavy wear on all components in the engine bay.

The system was designed to work with any model PT Cruiser (2001-2010), but specifically for the turbo models that frequently have failed PCMs.

The intended system behavior is to activate the low speed fan relay for 5 minutes upon shutting the engine off, then it will automatically turn off. If during the 5 minutes, the battery voltage drops below a certain threshold, the system will deactivate the cooling fan.

In this repo you will find the code, PCB design files, and 3D models for printing.
